Main Server Socket Created by Youssef Elashry to solve the common problem for TWO-WAY communication Unity/C# applications with Python 3.

The files attached will allow you to both send and receive data between Unity (C#) and Python 3.

Feel free to use this in your individual or commercial projects BUT make sure to reference me as: Two-way communication between Python 3 and Unity (C#) - Y. T. Elashry
It would be appreciated if you send me how you have used this in your projects (e.g. Machine Learning) at youssef.elashry@gmail.com
