<|startoftext|>A Lesson to Learn<|obj|>Speak with Dendrite Starblaze in the village of Nighthaven, Moonglade.<|text|>, I have been following your progress with much delight. You are most assuredly developing yourself into a valued protector of nature. The time has come for you to learn more about one of the various animal aspects that Cenarius has blessed us with the ability to change into - one that affords you command and mastery of the water. For this, you must travel to the village of Nighthaven in Moonglade and speak with Dendrite Starblaze of the Cenarion Circle there. He will guide you further.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kanrethad's Quest<|obj|>Speak to Kanrethad to restore your talents, weapon and mount.<|text|>Welcome back from the world of death. In an age long past you stood proud, a hero among your brethren. Now you stand fallen and broken - a relic of the past. Stand before me, as I awaken the legend that you once were. I shall restore the weapons and powers you have lost, making you whole once again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rise of the Silithid<|obj|>Take the report to Zilzibin Drumlore in Orgrimmar.<|text|>Here's your report. I urge you to take it to someone who might have working knowledge in this kind of thing. I know this troll scholar named Zilzibin Drumlore. He's spent a lot of time studying life forms that are unique to the ecology of Azeroth; he's a historian to boot! If you want someone to help figure out what exactly this threat is and how to stop it, give this report to him. We're going to need all the help we can get. Zil lives in a house on the second tier of the Drag in Orgrimmar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> Wolves Across the Border<|obj|>Bring 8 Diseased Wolf Pelts to Eagan Peltskinner outside Northshire Abbey.<|text|>Whatever is affecting these wolves isn't going away. Each day that passes brings forth more sick wolves. It pains me to ask anyone to kill nature's beasts, but we must destroy the diseased young wolves before this little outbreak turns into an epidemic. Kill diseased young wolves in the valley and bring me their diseased wolf pelts as proof of your deed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aquatic Form<|obj|>Return to Thunder Bluff and show Turak Runetotem the Pendant of the Sea Lion.<|text|>You have completed the necessary lessons all young druids are taught before they can adopt an aquatic aspect. Go now back to your trainer, Turak Runetotem, in Thunder Bluff. Show him your pendant and prove to him you are ready to learn what he has to teach you. He will complete your training, allowing you to become one with the water. Goodbye, young druid. We shall speak again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trial of the Sea Lion<|obj|>Find the Half Pendant of Aquatic Agility and the Half Pendant of Aquatic Endurance. Speak with the residents of Moonglade to learn clues as to where these items may be located.<|text|>For the second trial, you'll need the two halves that make the Pendant of the Sea Lion. One half draws power from the agility of the sea lion aspect, gliding through water; the other draws power from the incredible endurance of the sea lion aspect. Druids draw on both these traits equally to embody the aspect of their aquatic form. Speak with the locals of Moonglade to learn where the parts may lie, and bring both here to join them together. Once formed, take the pendant to Dendrite Starblaze.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trial of the Lake<|obj|>Find a Shrine Bauble in Lake Elune'ara, and take it to the Shrine of Remulos in northwestern Moonglade. Once there, use the Shrine Bauble.<|text|>For your first trial, search the depths of Lake Elune'ara to locate a Shrine Bauble. It decays rapidly, so proceed with it to the Shrine of Remulos post haste. Use the bauble at the shrine, and then speak with Tajarri there; she is one of Moonglade's most trusted wardens. You only have a set amount of time to complete the task, and you may be competing against other druids searching for baubles themselves. Mental and physical dexterity will be critical to your success. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Shadumbra's Head<|obj|>Bring Shadumbra's Head to Captain Goggath at Hellscream's Watch.<|text|>The once swift Shadumbra now lies still as you claim victory over it. This legenday creature is dear to the night elves. Its head should serve as an intimidating trophy, and as a sign of the end of the Alliance in Ashenvale. Captain Goggath at Hellscream's Watch will no doubt be delighted to receive the head of the slain nightsaber.<|endoftext|>
